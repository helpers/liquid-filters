## Heads up!

This library is a work-in-progress and should not be used in production yet!

## Usage

```js
// the main export is a function that must be called
const filters = require('{%= name %}');

console.log(filters());
console.log(filters('math'));
console.log(filters(['math', 'string']));
```

## Attribution

Some of these filters were ported from:

- Shopify Liquid
- Jekyll
